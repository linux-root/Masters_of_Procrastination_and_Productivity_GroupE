The equals method in the Employee class doesn't override the equals method
from the Object class correctly. When comparing the Employee objects in the list,
the contains method relies on the equals method to determine if an object is in
the list. So the result is false.

to fix this, you should override the equals method from the Object class properly.

	@Override
	public int hashCode() {
		return Objects.hash(name, salary);
	}

	@Override
	public boolean equals(Object obj) {
		if (this == obj)
			return true;
		if (obj == null)
			return false;
		if (getClass() != obj.getClass())
			return false;
		Employee other = (Employee) obj;
		return Objects.equals(name, other.name) && salary == other.salary;
	}
